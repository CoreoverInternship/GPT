When a star with a mass greater than about three times the mass of the Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer sustain the pressure needed to counteract gravitational pull. As a result, the core collapses under its own gravity into a single point known as a singularity, creating a black hole. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape from it, which is why it appears black.",
        "model_response": "A black hole forms as a result of a massive expansion caused by a massive contraction of the speed of light. This contraction causes a black hole to grow at a rate of approximately 10^-times the speed of light. This growth is accelerated by the gravitational pull exerted on the black hole, which is stronger than the gravitational pull exerted on the Earth. This force is felt as a gravitational pull on the Earth, which is stronger than the gravitational pull exerted on the Sun."

The allocation of resources can be influenced by the nature of the market economy and the variability of the resources. The allocation of resources can also be influenced by the nature of the resources themselves. Supply can be higher in a country where resources are scarce and resources are abundant, or lower in a country where resources are scarce and scarce resources are abundant.

Using light energy absorbed by chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, these substances are converted into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). The general chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2.
